The file sql.el contains simple emacs commands that make it a bit easier to
code pl/sql.  Here are some of the more useful functions and quick key (if
it's defined):

sql-procedure		\C-cp
  Create a pl/sql procedure. The procedure includes an exception handler and
  delclares the variable proc_name. You will have to replace all occurences
  of the string "$$$" with the name of the procedure.

sql-function		\C-cf
  Same as sql-procedure above but for functions. You will also have to
  replace "%%%" with the return value type.

sql-comment-block	\C-cc
  Create a pl/sql comment block.

sql-htp-print		\C-ch
  Print the string "htp.print('');" and put the cursor between the single
  quotes.

sql-put-line		\C-co
  Print the string "DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('');" and put the cursor between
  the single quotes.

sql-debug		\C-c\C-d
  Print the string "logit.DEBUG(1,'');" and put the cursor between the
  single quotes.

sql-varchar2		\C-cv
  Print the string "VARCHAR2".

sql-boolean		\C-cb
  Print the string "BOOLEAN".

sql-number		\C-cn
  Print the string "NUMBER".

sql-integer		\C-ci
  Print the string "INTEGER".

sql-date		\C-cd
  Print the string "DATE".

sql-clean-log-params
  After you've copied the parameters for a PL/SQL routine from the OWS error
  log, run this code on the buffer and it will strip out all of the garbage
  leaving you with the parameter list for your routine.

To use this, either copy it into your .emacs file or save it in your
home directory use the emacs command "load" to load the file when
emacs starts up

	(load "sql.el")
